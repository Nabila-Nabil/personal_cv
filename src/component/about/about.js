            My curiosity drives me to explore and follow the path to wonder and
            harmony in the world ,as my eyes marvel at every little detail
            somewhere along the way i started creating my own wonder I'm an
            introvert with a galaxy of imagination I'm here because I'm perusing
            my passion of learning new things, and making the world a better place
            through technology. I've a long road ahead of me ,but I'm enjoying
            every moment ,and seizing every opportunity to evolve as a person as
            well as developing my skills
